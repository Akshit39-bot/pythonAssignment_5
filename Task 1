# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
# 2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
# 3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
# 4.   If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message.

code:

students_marks = {'Akshit': 45 , 'Harshveer': 45, 'Vasudev': 45}

name =  input("enter student's name: ")

if name in students_marks:
    print(f"{name}'s marks: {students_marks[name]}")

else:
    print(f"student {name} not found in records")
